# PDF Document Question Answering LLM System

This repository contains code and resources for building a Question Answering Language Model (LLM) system that operates on PDF documents using a generative approach to artificial intelligence. The system integrates various technologies including Langchain, Cassandra, Astra DB, and Vector Database.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust system capable of extracting information from PDF documents and answering questions based on the content of these documents using a generative approach to artificial intelligence. The system utilizes advanced language models and deep learning techniques to generate contextually relevant answers even for complex queries.

## Generative AI Approach

The system utilizes generative artificial intelligence techniques to understand and generate responses to questions based on the content of PDF documents. By leveraging advanced language models and deep learning architectures, the system can generate contextually relevant answers even for complex queries.

## Technologies Used

- **Langchain**: Langchain provides language understanding capabilities and enables the processing of natural language input.
- **Cassandra**: Cassandra is used for storing and managing large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Astra DB**: Astra DB is a cloud-native distributed database built on Apache Cassandra.
- **Vector Database**: Vector Database is employed for efficient storage and retrieval of vector-based data structures.

Below is the output generated by the system:




## Usage


- Experiment with different PDF documents and questions to test the accuracy and performance of the system.
